# Driver-Perspective-Simulation-in-Unity
Developed a real-time driver-perspective simulation in Unity 3D with realistic day-night and weather conditions for VR testing using C# scripting and physics-based models. Implemented AI pedestrian spawning and waypoint navigation for footpath movement and adaptive traffic logic.

Overview 
The Driver Perspective is mainly developed for the testing of the Virtual World with the relastic environment. The Driver will experience the game with all the realistic effects. The Project consists of many sub parts like First creating the environment with Day-Night, Rain, Fog, Snow climate. Then Importing the car model and with the help of scripting and physics making it feel realistic, showcasing the various characters like walking, running, chatting, dancing pedestrians to create the distractions for the driver. The project even consists of Realistic roads, buildings, traffic system and market many more.
